While I mainly want this blog to be focused on my tech and programming experiences, I also have lots of different interests (which you can find out about on my [About](/posts/about) page). And rather than just tweeting out random things that I've enjoyed ([which I still kinda do if you want to see that](https://twitter.com/bradywalters_)), I want to add more content here and work on my writing skills. 

So here are just some of the things that I enjoyed during the month of February. Sorry this is coming a few weeks late, March has been fairly wild for me so far. 

## Pro Bowl

I moved to Las Vegas last summer and it is overwhelming how much stuff is going on in this town at all times. Pretty much any time I feel like going and doing something I can find something interesting to do. Since I'm more of an introvert this is pretty rare, but I had some family coming down for the Pro Bowl, so I decided to join them, and I'm glad that I did!

This was actually my first NFL game ever. Growing up in Boise, Idaho meant we were 8+ hour drive away from the Seattle Seahawks, who were the closest team to us. I don't recommend making the Pro Bowl your first game, but I still had a great time.

The best part was checking out Allegiant Stadium. The new stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, is absolutely incredible. The food and the atmosphere were really good, and I really want to go to a regular season game soon. Maybe now that my team, the Denver Broncos, have Russell Wilson I'll make an effort to watch them play here next year üôÇ

## The FOSS Pod

One of my favorite podcasts every week is [The Tech Pod with Brad & Will](https://techpod.content.town). As someone who willingly creates ridiculous tech projects for myself all the time, this podcast is very fun and informative. And I was very happy to find out that they were starting a new podcast about Free and Open Source Software called [The Foss Pod](https://fosspod.content.town/).

So far it's only a couple episodes in and I absolutely love the topics that have been covered. I highly recommend the first episode where they interviewed Jim Bailey, the original creator of Open Broadcast Software or OBS. As someone who streams fairly regularly, I've been using OBS on and off for like six or seven years and it blows my mind that something this well made is free. 

I've always wanted to contribute to an open source project, but it can be very intimidating, especially with large projects like OBS. But, listening to this podcast makes me excited about the open source community and makes me want to try and help it any way I can.

## The Winter Olympics

I won't go to into this topic too much, but I am a sucker for large sporting events, and even though there were a lot of negatives this year, I still really enjoy having the Olympics on in the background during the day. I've never been much of a winter sports person, but seeing people compete at the highest level is always interesting to me. 

## Climate Change Videos

Thanks to [Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes), a YouTube channel about urban planning I've been following for a little bit, I found another YouTube channel that I really enjoy called [Climate Town](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVLG9pThvBABcYCm7pkNkA).

The channel is all about climate change and all the ways we are failing to meet the crisis, and how we as individuals can try and make a difference. It's probably not for everyone, but even if you don't spend your time watching 20 minute videos on a depressing subject (which is fair, tbh), I think a lot of people would enjoy the humor of the videos.

And of course, through the humor I believe the videos bring up really good points about climate change and what we need to do as a society to try and combat it. Humor and knowledge, good combo!

## King's Quest V Let's Play

Alright this one is weird, but I re-watched this amazing playthrough of King's Quest V and I just love it so much.

First of all King's Quest V is a ridiculous game. I'm a little too young to have played through the classic adventure games like these, but I love watching people play them. I get to see all of the comedy and wild puzzles without the frustration of playing it myself.

Second, two of the people in this Let's Play, Soha and Kelsey, [stream themselves playing games every week](https://www.twitch.tv/itstheweekendgames) and it is my favorite stream. Seriously they are so funny, I love the games they pick to play, and it's just a wonderful thing to watch on a Sunday afternoon. üíì

## Level Up Expo

Last one is another weird one, a few of my students let me know that there was a ‚Äúnerd‚Äù convention coming to Las Vegas called Level Up Expo, and I decided to go for a day. Growing up in Idaho, there weren't really any large conventions like this near me. I went to PAX West in 2017 which was super fun, but this was on a completely different level.

The amount of people completely overwhelmed me. I'm not sure what the attendance numbers were, but there were thousands of people in one section of the Las Vegas Convention Center. It was hard to even get into the venue, let alone walk around once you got inside. 

I had a lot of fun but the feeling that has stuck with me afterwards has been the sensory overload that I experienced there. Next time I want to go with some friends and spend more time there, but it was still a fun time!

Alright that's all I got for February, hopefully I can get March's up sooner than this one! You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bradywalters_) if you want to talk about any of these things or have any suggestions or feedback.
