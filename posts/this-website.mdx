*(Yes I know it's weird to call things like CSS and Markdown languages, I couldn't think of a better way to list these)*

Alright so here it is, my personal website/blog. I haven't really done a ton of front end work prior to creating this site other than the HTML and CSS I learned during my years in school, so this was a real treat. If you want to look at how far I've come, you can take a look at an old project from my web dev class [here on my Github](https://github.com/BradyWalters/proesportsinfo) where I created an esports score website. I'm honestly still amazed it still works.

I decided to go with NextJS for this site because it seems to be the go-to choice for it's flexibility and usability. I was extremely happy with how easy it was to get up and started, even for me who has been away from web development for a while. 

I also really appreciated the [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) that Vercel has in their NextJS documentation, especially since the tutorial has you create a Markdown blog, very similar to what I ended up creating, with some tweaks to fit my needs. 

I also decided to stick with a simple Markdown blog rather than adding a CMS on top, even though I want to make a site that includes a CMS in the future. I really just wanted to get this site up and running so I can start writing and making fun projects, and since I'm the only one who will be writing on this blog, this seemed like the best choice. I also want to write more Markdown anyways, so really this is a win-win. Speaking of which, I want to give a quick shout out to [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) which has become my go-to notes app, which lets me both write in Markdown and export to Markdown.

Speaking of Markdown, one problem I faced during development was trying to insert a PDF of my resume into the 'About Me' blog post. Since I originally had the blog be just basic Markdown, I couldn't find an easy way to have my resume from my Google Drive embedded into the Markdown itself. So, after some research, I decided to use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for my blog posts, which allows you to use both Markdown and JSX in the same file. And luckily [Next has a plugin for MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx), and [Ebenezer Don posted on the WebStorm Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2021/10/building-a-blog-with-next-js-and-mdx/) about creating a NextJS blog using MDX in October 2021, right around the time I was building this!

The other big decision I made for this site was using a little bit of [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/), for example, the icons on the left, along with the Drawer on the left on mobile, and the Cards for the blog list. The main reason I decided to do this is was again to try and get a relatively nice looking site up as quickly as possible, because I wanted to make sure I got to actually writing on the site and creating new stuff, and I have definitely been stuck in designing and CSS before. Obviously the holidays got in the way, and also I was pretty busy toward the end of the year with teaching, but overall I think using MaterialUI achieved the goal I wanted. Funnily enough, I spent a decent amount of time during the holidays learning about CSS from both [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/) and [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/), and now I really want to try using plain old CSS on my next project. 

Lastly, I decided to use Netlify to host my site, because of its great free tier and ease of use with Next. I currently have it hooked up to my Github repo so any time I push to it the site rebuilds, which is super nice and kind of amazing.

### Next Steps

While the site is now to a place that I feel comfortable posting to it, there is still some stuff I want to add. First off, I want to work on the SEO of the site so that it shows up somewhat early on in Google when my name is searched. Unfortunately there are several Brady Walters's out there, one of which played football at the University of Florida, so I have some work to do. Although it is kind of nice that my students can't find all my work when they Google me ðŸ™‚

Next I want to add categories to the sidebar that will filter the blog posts. I'm preemptively adding categories to the front matter of my posts, because while I want to mainly focus on tech things on this blog, I also have a lot of different interests so I want the option to post different things. So if prospective employers come to my site, they can filter to only view my projects so they don't have to read through my video game hot takes or whatever else I decide to post here. 

Then other than that I really want to try and make the site look better. I've struggled with making things look nice throughout my time as a developer, and instead of just sticking my head in the sand and claiming to be just a back end developer, I want to try and improve on my weakness and make the best looking sites I can. That's why I spent the holidays learning about CSS, which I promise isn't as sad as it sounds. I also spent a ton of time with my family whom I missed very much. 

Oh and DARK MODE. I need a dark mode for my site.
